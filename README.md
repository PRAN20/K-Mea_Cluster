# K-Mea_Cluster
K-means clustering is a method used for clustering analysis, especially in data mining and statistics. It aims to partition a set of observations into a number of clusters (k), resulting in the partitioning of the data into Voronoi cells. It can be considered a method of finding out which group a certain object really belongs to.
